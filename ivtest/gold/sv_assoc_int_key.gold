Testing associative array with integer keys:
PASSED: exists on empty array returns 0
PASSED: num() = 3
PASSED: size() = 3
PASSED: exists(20) = 1
PASSED: exists(99) = 0
PASSED: arr[10] = 100
PASSED: arr[10] updated to 111
PASSED: delete(20) worked
PASSED: num() after delete = 2
PASSED: exists(-5) = 1
PASSED: arr[-5] = 500
